A governance action service is a specialized [connector](./concepts/connector) that performs monitoring of metadata changes, validation of metadata, triage of issues, assessment and/or remediation activities on request.  It runs in the [Governance Action Open Metadata Engine Service (OMES)](./services/omes/governance-action) hosted by the [Engine Host OMAG Server](./concepts/engine-host).

There are five types of governance action services:
  
* *[Watchdog Governance Service](./guides/developer/governance-action-services/watchdog-governance-service)* listens for changes to metadata and initiates
  [governance actions](./concepts/governance-action), [governance action processes](./concepts/governance-action-process)
  or an [incident report](./concepts/incident-report).
  
* *[Verification Governance Service](./guides/developer/governance-action-services/verification-governance-service)* validates that the metadata elements, relationships and
  classification are set up as they should be.  For example, it may check that a new asset has an owner, is set up
  with zones and includes a connection and a schema there possible.  It produces [guards](./concepts/guard)
  that define what needs to be done.
  
* *[Triage Governance Service](./guides/developer/governance-action-services/triage-governance-service)* runs triage rules to determine how to manage a situation or request.
  Often this involves a human decision maker.   It may initiate an external workflow, wait for manual
  decision or create a *[To Do](./concepts/to-do)* for a specific person.
  
* *[Remediation Governance Service](./guides/developer/governance-action-services/remediation-governance-service)* makes updates to metadata elements, relationships between them
  and classifications. Examples of remediation governance action services are duplicate linking and consolidating.

* *[Provisioning Governance Service](./guides/developer/governance-action-services/provisioning-governance-service)*  invokes a provisioning service whenever a provisioning request is made. 
  Typically the provisioning service is an external service.  It may also create lineage metadata to
  describe the work of the provisioning engine.
