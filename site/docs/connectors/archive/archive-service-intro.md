An *archive service* is a [specialized connector](./concepts/connector) that maintains an [open metadata archive](./concepts/open-metadata-archive). It is hosted in the [Archive Manager OMES](./services/omes/archive-manager/overview) which is, in turn, running in an [engine host](./concepts/engine-host) OMAG server.

An archive service can:

- Register a listener with the Enterprise OMAS Topic to receive notifications from any of the repositories connected via [Open Metadata Repository Cohorts](./concepts/cohort-member).
- Issue requests to find and retrieve metadata instances from any of the repositories connected via Open Metadata Repository Cohorts.
- Incrementally build and store an open metadata archive.
