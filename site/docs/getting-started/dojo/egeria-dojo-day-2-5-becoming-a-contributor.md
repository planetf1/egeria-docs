## What does it mean to be recognized as an Egeria contributor?

An **Egeria Contributor** is someone who has made multiple quality contributions to the Egeria community.
This role is described in the [Operations Guide](./guides/project-operations).

## Egeria badges

To recognise individuals who are established contributors to the Egeria project,
the Egeria community is able to award [Acclaim badges](./contributor/badges/overview).

## Test yourself

Using the material from the Egeria operations guide
answer the following questions.

* How many contributors are listed for the Egeria project?
* What is the DCO?
* How often do the maintainers create a release of Egeria?
