# Discovery Analysis Report

The *discovery analysis report* lists the [discovery annotations](./guides/developer/open-discovery-services/discovery-annotations) that were created during the execution of an [open discovery service](./guides/developer/open-discovery-services/overview).

The discovery analysis report is created in the open metadata repository by the [discovery engine](./concepts/open-discovery-engine) when it creates the discovery service instance. The discovery service can retrieve information about the discovery analysis report through the [discovery analysis report store](./guides/developer/open-discovery-services/discovery-analysis-report-store) client.

This client is accessed through the [discovery annotation store](./guides/developer/open-discovery-services/discovery-annotation-store).

The discovery analysis report store also enables a long running discovery service (typically a [discovery pipeline](./guides/developer/open-discovery-services/discovery-pipeline)) to record its current analysis step.

## Discovery annotations

[Annotations](./guides/developer/open-discovery-services/discovery-annotation) are metadata elements that describe a particular finding from the execution of an open discovery service.
