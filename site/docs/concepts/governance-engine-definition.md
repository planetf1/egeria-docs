# Governance Engine Definition

A *governance engine definition* describes the [services](./concepts/governance-service) that can be invoked in a [governance engine](./concepts/governance-engine).  It consists of a list of [governance request types](./concepts/governance-request-type) that define the logical names of each of the functions of the governance engine.  Each governance request type is mapped to at least one [governance service](./concepts/governance-service) implementation along with request parameters to configure the behaviour of the service in a [governance engine definition](./concepts/governance-engine).

There are three types of governance engine ([archive engine](./concepts/archive-engine), [open discovery engine](./concepts/open-discovery-engine), [governance action engine](./concepts/governance-action-engine)) and they each support a specialist type of governance service ([archive service](./guides/developer/archive-services/overview), [open discovery service](./guides/developer/open-discovery-services/overview) and [governance action service](./guides/developer/governance-action-services/overview) respectively).  Therefore the governance engine definitions include definitions of governance services that are consistent with the type of governance engine.

??? education "Further information"

    The Open Metadata Types model [0461 Governance Action Engines](./types/4/0461-Governance-Engines) shows the types for a governance engine definition.
    
    Governance engine definitions are typically defined in a [governance engine pack](./concepts/governance-engine-pack) or through the [Governance Engine OMAS](./services/omas/governace-engine/overview) API.

    Governance engines are run by the [Open Metadata Engine Services (OMES)](./services/omes) in an [Engine Host](./concepts/engine-host) OMAG Server.  The [Engine Host Services](./services/engine-host-services) called the [Governance Engine OMAS](./services/omas/governance-engine/overview)
