# Audit Log

The audit log provides detailed information relating to the activities within an [OMAG Server](./concepts/omag-server).

It builds on the [Audit Log Framework](./frameworks/alf/overview) to support [multiple destinations](./concepts/audit-log-destination-connector) for the audit log records written to the audit log by the server's subsystems.

There is more information on the use of audit logging in the [Diagnostic Guide](./guides/diagnostic).
