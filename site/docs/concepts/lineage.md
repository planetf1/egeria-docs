# Lineage

Lineage shows how data flows from its origins to its various destinations. This includes details of the processing along the way.  It is used to understand:
 
* whether the data used in reports and analytics models has come from the correct sources and has passed through the correct processing (known as *traceability of data*).
  
* what would be the impact on downstream processing and consumers if something was changed (known as *impact analysis*).

* whether the operational processes that implement the data flows are executing correctly (known as *governance by expectation*).

[Lineage Management](./features/lineage-management/overview) describes how lineage is collected, managed and used in Egeria.
