# Resource

The term *resource* is used throughout the Egeria documentation to refer to something - either physical or digital - that is of value to the operation of the organization, or to the services it provides.

Resources are described in metadata as [Assets](asset.md).

In addition, the organization may capture intellectual property in metadata as, for example, a [glossary term](./concepts/glossary-term) or a governance definition.
