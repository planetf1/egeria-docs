# Archive Engine

The archive engine describes a set of related [archive services](./guides/developer/archive-services/overview) that dynamically manage [open metadata archives](./concepts/open-metadata-archives).

An archive engine is hosted in the [Archive Manager Open Metadata Engine Service (OMES)](./services/omes/archive-manager/overview) running on one or more [Engine Host OMAG Servers](./concepts/engine-host).

When an archive engine is called, it is passed a governance request type and request parameters. This is mapped to a call to an archive service through the [archive engine definition](./concepts/governance-engine-definition).
