# Open Metadata Type Definitions (TypeDefs)

TypeDefs define the characteristics of a particular type of an [open metadata instance/element](./concepts/open-metadata-instances)
There are three categories of TypeDefs (`TypeDefCategory`):

- *EntityDef*: the definition of a type of [entity](./concepts/open-metadata-instances)
- *RelationshipDef*: the definition of a type of [relationship](./concepts/open-metadata-instances)
- *ClassificationDef*: the definition of a type of [classification](./concepts/open-metadata-instances)

TypeDefs can inherit from other TypeDefs from the same category.  Open metadata support single inheritance.

TypeDefs also define then names and types of properties for a metadata instance of that type.
Each property has a *TypeDefAttribute* definition that references an **AttributeTypeDef**
as its type.

The AttributeTypeDefs are the type definitions for properties.
There are three categories of AttributeTypeDefs.

- *EnumDef*: the definition of an enumerated list of valid values.
- *CollectionDef*: the definition of a collection - such as an array of strings, or a map from string to object.
- *PrimitiveDef*: a primitive - such as a string, integer or date.
