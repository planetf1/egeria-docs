# User identity

Every user accessing the open metadata ecosystem has a unique user identity (userId).
This identity is used for authentication, authorization and auditing of activity
related to open metadata and governance.

A user identity identifies the logon (security) account of the user.

The user may be a person, or an automated process/engine.
Either way, user identities should not be shared between people or automated process/engines.

A user identity may be associated with a
[personal profile](personal-profile.md).
This is managed through the [Community Profile OMAS](./services/omas/community-profile/overview)
and is designed to support collaboration.
