# Metadata Access Point

A *metadata access point* is an [OMAG Server](omag-server.md) that can be a [member of a cohort](./concepts/cohort-member) and supports the [access services](./services/omas).

This means it provides specialist metadata APIs to user interfaces and governance servers that embrace metadata from all connected open metadata repository cohorts.

The basic metadata access point has no metadata repository and metadata is retrieved and stored from remote repositories via the [cohort](./concepts/cohort-member). It can be upgraded to a [metadata access store](./concepts/metadata-access-store) by adding a metadata repository which will enable it to store metadata locally.
