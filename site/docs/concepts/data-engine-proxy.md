# Data engine proxy

The *data engine proxy* is a [governance server](./concepts/governance-server) that can capture metadata about data movement processes (such as ETL jobs) from a data engine.  This information results in new [Process](./types/0/0010-Base-Model) being defined in open metadata linked to the data sources that it works with. This is valuable information for [lineage](./features/lineage-management/overview).

![Data Engine Proxy](data-engine-proxy.svg)

The data engine proxy is paired with the [Data Engine OMAS](./services/omas/data-engine/overview). Its connector interfaces are defined in the [data-engine-proxy-connector :material-github:](https://github.com/odpi/egeria/tree/master/open-metadata-implementation/governance-servers/data-engine-proxy-services/data-engine-proxy-connector){ target=gh } module.
