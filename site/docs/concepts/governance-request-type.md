# Governance Request Type

The *governance request type* defines the descriptive name of a specific governance activity that the organization wishes to run.

The request type is mapped to a [governance service](./concepts/governance-service) implementation along with request parameters to configure the behaviour of the service in a [governance engine definition](./concepts/governance-engine) as shown in Figure 1.

> **Figure 1:** Governance request types as part of a governance engine definition

Governance services are run by the [Open Metadata Engine Services (OMES)](./services/omes) in an [Engine Host](./concepts/engine-host) OMAG Server.  The [Engine Host Services](./services/engine-host-services) in the engine host call the [Governance Engine OMAS](./services/omas/governance-engine/overview) to retrieve the governance engine definition.  When a [governance action](./concepts/governance-action) request is made, the supplied request type is used by the OMES to determine which [Governance Service](./concepts/governance-service) to run.


??? education "Further information"

    The Open Metadata Types model *[0461 Governance Action Engines](./types/4/0461-Governance-Engines)* shows how the request type links the governance engine to the governance service via the *SupportedGovernanceService* relationship.
    
    Governance engine definitions are typically maintained as a [governance engine pack](./concepts/governance-engine-pack).  They may also be defined through the [Governance Engine OMAS](./services/omas/governance-engine/overview)
