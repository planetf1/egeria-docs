# Karma Point Plateau

A karma point plateau identifies a significant contribution to open metadata.
By default, a karma point plateau is achieved for every 500 [karma points](karma-point.md) awarded.
However the threshold for the karma point plateau can be 
[changed at server start up](./concepts/karma-point-plateau).

The Community Profile OMAS generates a
[Karma Point Plateau Event](./concepts/karma-point-plateau)
each time a person achieves a karma point plateau.
This is sent on the Community Profile OMAS's [OutTopic](./concepts/out-topic)
