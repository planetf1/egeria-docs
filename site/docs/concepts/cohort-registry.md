# Cohort Registry

The *Cohort Registry* resides in each *[cohort member](./concepts/cohort-member)*.   It is responsible for registering a member with a specific cohort and maintaining a list of the other members of this cohort.

The registration process is managed by exchanging [Registry Events](./concepts/cohort-events#registry-events) over the [Cohort Topic](./concepts/cohort-events#cohort-topics).

The cohort registry maintains its record of the membership of the cohort in a [Cohort Registry Store](./concepts/cohort-registry-store-connector).
