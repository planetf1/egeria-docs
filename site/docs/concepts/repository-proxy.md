# Repository Proxy

A *repository proxy* is an [OMAG Server](./concepts/omag-server) that has been configured to act as a proxy to a third party metadata repository. 

![Repository proxy translating between third party APIs/events and open metadata](repository-proxy.svg)

The repository proxy hosts a repository connector to wrap the third party metadata server's APIs and an optional event mapper connector.  There are two repository connector implementations included with Egeria:

- [Repository connectors for Apache Atlas :material-dock-window:](https://github.com/odpi/egeria-connector-hadoop-ecosystem){ target=atlas }
- [Repository connectors for IBM Information Governance Catalog (IGC) :material-dock-window:](https://github.com/odpi/egeria-connector-ibm-information-server){ target=infosvr }
