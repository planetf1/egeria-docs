# Informal Tag

An informal tag is a descriptive label with optional description that can be
attached to resources such as personal profiles, personal messages, personal notes,
community forums and forum contributions, comments and communities.

An informal tag can be public (visible to all users) or private (visible only to the user that created it).

Any user can create, update, delete and assign/unassign public informal tags.  Informal tags can be used to mine user knowledge about a topic.

Support for informal tags is found in the following services:

  * [Asset Consumer OMAS](./services/omas/asset-consumer/overview) - informal tagging of assets
  * [Community Profile OMAS](./services/omas/community-profile/overview) - informal tagging of personal profiles, collaboration content and community content.

The process of adding a tag to an object is called *tagging*.
