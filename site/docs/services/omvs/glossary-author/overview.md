# Glossary Author Open Metadata View Service (OMVS)

Develop a definition of a subject area by authoring glossaries, including terms for use by a user interface. The Glossary Author OMVS is for user interfaces that support subject matter experts
who are defining glossaries, reference data and rules around data for a specific subject area, such as "customer data". 

This OMVS calls a remote server using the [Subject Area OMAS](./services/omas/subject-area/overview).
