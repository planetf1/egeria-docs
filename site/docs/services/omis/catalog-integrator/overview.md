# Catalog Integrator Open Metadata Integration Service (OMIS)

The Catalog Integrator OMIS supports the exchange of asset information between a
third party asset management system and the open metadata ecosystem.

This involves:
* the transformation of metadata structures and names from the third party's APIs
to the open metadata APIs and types.
* the mapping of identifiers from the third party technology.

This integration service is paired with the [Asset Manager OMAS](./services/omas/asset-manager/overview).
