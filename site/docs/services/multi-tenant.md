# OMAG Multi-Tenant Services

The Open Metadata and Governance (OMAG) Multi-Tenant Services supports the management of
[OMAG Server](./concepts/omag-server) instances
running in an [OMAG Server Platform](./concepts/omag-server-platform).

It maintains a map of **server name** to **server instance** in the
OMAG Server Platform that is used to retrieve the server instance when an inbound
REST API call is made to a specific server.
