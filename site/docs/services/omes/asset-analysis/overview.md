# Asset Analysis Open Metadata Engine Service (OMES)

The Asset Analysis OMES provides support for [open discovery engines](./concepts/open-discovery-engine) that are part of the [Open Discovery Service (ODF)](./frameworks/odf/overview).

## Open discovery engines

An open discovery engine hosts [automated metadata discovery](./features/discovery-and-stewardship/overview).

The Asset Analysis OMES is capable of hosting one or more [open discovery engines](./concepts/open-discovery-engine) and supports a REST API to request that an open discovery engine runs an [open discovery service](./guides/developer/open-discovery-services/overview) to analyse a [digital resource](./concepts/resource). The results of this analysis is a [discovery analysis report](./concepts/discovery-analysis-report) that is attached to the resource's [asset](./concepts/asset).

The REST API also supports a request to a discovery engine to run a specific open discovery service against each asset it has access to.

The discovery engine services call the [Discovery Engine Open Metadata Access Service (OMAS)](./services/omas/discovery-engine/overview) running in an open metadata server to retrieve information about assets and to store the discovery analysis reports.
