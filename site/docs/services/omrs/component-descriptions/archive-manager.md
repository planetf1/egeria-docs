# OMRS Archive Manager

An [open metadata archive](./concepts/open-metadata-archive) provides pre-built definitions
for types and metadata instances.

**OMRSArchiveManager** manages the loading and unloading of open metadata archives for the local OMRS repository.
It is invoked at server start up for a [cohort member](./concepts/cohort-member)
and whenever a new open metadata archive is loaded via a REST API.
 
During server start up, it first calls the [Repository Content Manager](repository-content-manager.md)
to load the types into the local repository (if any) and to maintain the cache of know and active types in the server.

It then calls the [Local Repository Instance Event Processor](local-repository-instance-event-processor.md) to
load the instances.
