# Software Developer Open Metadata Access Service (OMAS)

The Software Developer OMAS provides APIs and events for software developer tools and applications that help developers make good use of the
standards and best practices defined for the data landscape.

It supports the documentation of the component structure of a software capability and the ability to link it to the [digital services](./services/omas/digital-service/overview) it supports for the business.  

As the software developer works on the implementation, the Software Developer OMAS supports APIs to search for data structure implementation snippets based on search criteria such as glossary terms and/or language. It also provides information about the most appropriate data sources to use for particular situations along with details of reference data values and sets. Using these services augments the software component model for the software capability.

Finally it enables the documentation of the packaging as the components are moved into the [DevOps Pipeline](./services/omas/dev-ops/overview).
