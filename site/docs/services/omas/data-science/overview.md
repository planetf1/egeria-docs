# Data Science Open Metadata Access Service (OMAS)

The Data Science OMAS provides APIs and events for tools and applications focused on building all types of analytics models such as predictive models and machine learning models.  It provides the ability to define the purpose and requirements for a model, along with lineage and audit information relating to the development and validation process associated with the model.

It also supports the packaging of the model into software components for consumption by the [Software Developer OMAS](./services/omas/software-developer/overview), [Digital Architecture OMAS](./services/omas/digital-architecture/overview) and [DevOps OMAS](./services/omas/dev-ops/overview) since the models ultimately provide the implementation of software components that form part of the implementation of a [digital service](./services/omas/digital-service/overview).
