# Governance Program Open Metadata Access Service (OMAS)

The Governance Program OMAS provides APIs and events for tools and applications focused on defining a data strategy, planning support for a regulation and/or developing a governance program for the data landscape.

It assumes an organization is operating an active governance program that is iteratively reviewed and developed.

It covers:

- Understanding the business drivers and regulations that provide the motivation and direction to the governance program.

- Laying down the governance policies (principles, obligations and approaches) that frame the governance program.

- Planning and defining the governance controls that detail how these governance policies will be implemented in the organization, and enumerating the implications of these decisions and the expected outcomes.

- Defining the organization's roles and responsibilities that will support the governance program.

- Defining the classifications and governance zones that will organize the assets being governed.

- Defining the subject areas that will organize the data-oriented definitions such as glossary terms, valid values and quality rules.

- Reviewing the impact of the governance program.
  - adjusting governance definitions and metrics as necessary.
  
- Reviewing the strategy, business and regulatory landscape.
  - adjusting the governance definitions and metrics as necessary.
