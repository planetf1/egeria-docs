# Governance Engine Open Metadata Access Service (OMAS)

The **Governance Engine OMAS** supports the implementation of a [governance program](../governance-program)
by providing the metadata services for running
**[governance engines](./concepts/governance-engine)**.

A governance engine is a collection of related 
**[governance services](./concepts/governance-service)** that provide pluggable
governance functions.  The governance services are implemented as 
specialist [connectors](./frameworks/ocf/overview) that are defined by:

 * [Open Discovery Framework (ODF)](./frameworks/odf/overview) for Open Discovery Services
   that analyse the content of resources in the digital landscape.
 * [Governance Action Framework (GAF)](./frameworks/gaf/overview) of Governance Action Services
   that monitor, assess and maintain metadata.

The governance services run in the [Engine Host OMAG Server](./concepts/engine-host)
supported by the [Open Metadata Engine Services (OMES)](./services/omes).
   
The Governance Engine OMAS has the following capabilities:

- Creating the definitions for [governance engines](./concepts/governance-engine) and their [governance services](./concepts/governance-service).
- Providing the APIs and events that enable the Engine Host OMAG Server to retrieve the definitions of the governance engines and services and be notified of any changes to them.
- Creating the definitions for [governance action processes](./concepts/governance-action-process) that control the sequencing of [governance actions](./concepts/governance-action).
- Providing APIs to create [governance actions](./concepts/governance-action) explicitly and [incident reports](./concepts/incident-report).
- Initiation and choreography of governance actions based on the template provided by  a [governance actions process](./concepts/governance-action-process).
- Notification of new [governance actions](./concepts/governance-action) to the  Engine Host OMAG Servers that then invoke the appropriate governance services to action them.
- Supporting the metadata requirements for many of the [engine services](./services/omes).
- Linking the governance actions, governance action processes and governance services to the governance definitions supported by the [Governance Program OMAS](./services/omas/governance-program/overview).
- Providing APIs to query the status of the governance capabilities implemented through the governance engines.

## Documentation

Governance Engine OMAS has a [User Guide](./guides/developer/java-clients/governance-engine) that covers the Governance Engine OMAS's APIs and events.  

The documentation for writing governance services is located in the developer guide:

- [Open Discovery Services](./guides/developer/open-discovery-services) for metadata discovery.
- [Governance Action Services](./guides/developer/governance-action-services) for the Governance Action Services: Watchdog Governance Services, Triage Governance Services, Verification Governance Services, Remediation Governance Services and Provisioning Governance Services.
