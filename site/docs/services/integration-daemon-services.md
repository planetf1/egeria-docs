# Integration Daemon Services

The integration daemon services provide the implementation
of the [Integration Daemon](./concepts/integration-daemon)
OMAG Server which is responsible for operating the 
[Open Metadata Integration Services (OMISs)](./services/omis).
The integration services are responsible for running connectors that exchange metadata with third party
technology.

> **Figure 1:** Integration daemon exchanging metadata with many types of third party technologies


Each type of integration service supports a particular type of connector interface that is designed to exchange
metadata with a specific [Open Metadata Access Services (OMASs)](./services/omas).
For example, the [Database Integrator OMIS](./services/omis/database-integrator/overview) calls the
[Data Manager OMAS](./omas/data-manager/overview).

Inside the Integration Daemon, the integration services
host the [integration connectors](docs/integration-connector.md) that manage the
exchange of metadata with third party technology.
