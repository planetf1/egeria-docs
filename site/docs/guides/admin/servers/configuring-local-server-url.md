## Set the server URL root

Configure the [local server URL root](./concepts/omag-server/#platform-url-root) with the value of the OMAG Server Platform where the service will run: in particular if the configuration document will be deployed to a different OMAG Server Platform from the one used to maintain the configuration document.

!!! post "POST - set server URL root"
    ```
    {{platformURLRoot}}/open-metadata/admin-services/users/{{adminUserId}}/servers/{{serverName}}/server-url-root?url={{targetPlatformURLRoot}}
    ```

??? question "Detailed explanation"
    The `{{targetPlatformURLRoot}}` gives the location of the OMAG Server Platform on which this configured service is intended to run, while the `{{platformURLRoot}}` gives the location of the OMAG Server Platform in which this configuration document is maintained.

    They could be, but do not need to be, the same location.
