# Watchdog Governance Services

The watchdog governance service monitors changes in the metadata and initiates one of the
following as a result.

* [governance action](./concepts/governance-action)
* [governance action process](./concepts/governance-action-process) 
* [incident report](./concepts/incident-report)

One example of a watchdog governance service is to monitor for new assets. 
Another example is to monitor the addition of
open discovery reports and take action on their content.
