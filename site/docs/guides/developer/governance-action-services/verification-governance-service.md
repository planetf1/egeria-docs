# Verification Governance Service

Verification Governance Services test the properties of specific open metadata elements
to ensure they are set up correctly and do not indicate a situation where governance activity is required. 
The results returned from the verification governance service can be used to trigger other
governance services as part of a [Governance Action Process](./concepts/governance-action-process).
