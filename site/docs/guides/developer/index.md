# Developer Guide

This guide supports developers wishing to customize Egeria to run in additional environments, exchange metadata with additional third party technologies and/or augment existing tools and utilities.

It is organized as follows:

- [Working with the platform APIs](#working-with-the-platform-apis) - Using Egeria APIs to configure and operate Egeria's [OMAG Server Platform](./concepts/omag-server-platform).

- [Using connectors](#using-connectors) - initializing and calling a connector from external services and other connectors.

- [Building connectors](#building-connectors) - How to write new [connectors](#what-is-a-connector) to integrate different technologies together.

- [Building open metadata archives](#building-open-metadata-archives) - Working with [Open Metadata Archives](./concepts/open-metadata-archive) to add new open metadata types or standard metadata definitions that can be shared and loaded into multiple metadata repositories.

- [Working with the open metadata and governance APIs](#working-with-the-open-metadata-and-governance-apis) - Using Egeria's open metadata and governance APIs to create new services or to augment existing services.

- [Adding your own registered services](#adding-registered-services) - Extending Egeria by adding new [registered services](./concepts/omag-subsystem/#registered-services).

## Working with the platform APIs

### Using the clients

The Egeria clients wrap calls to Egeria's [REST APIs](#using-the-rest-apis) and topics. The aim is to provide a language-specific interface that manages the marshalling and de-marshalling of the call parameters and responses to these services.

### Using the REST APIs

Egeria supports REST [APIs](./basic-concepts/#application-programming-interface-api) for making synchronous (request-response) calls between [OMAG Servers](./concepts/omag-server) and between clients and OMAG Servers.

!!! attention "REST APIs are intended for internal use"
    The REST APIs are usable directly for calling from non-Java platforms; however, they are designed for the internal use of Egeria and are not guaranteed to be backwards compatible.

The structure of the URL for an Egeria REST API varies lightly depending on whether it is a call to an [OMAG Server Platform](./concepts/omag-server-platform) service or an [OMAG Server](./concepts/omag-server) service.

### Configuration

The configuration for a connector is managed in a [*connection*](./concepts/connection) object.

A connection contains properties about the specific use of the connector, such as userId and password, or parameters that control the scope or resources that should be made available to the connector. It links to an optional [*endpoint*](./concepts/endpoint) and a mandatory [*connector type*](./concepts/connector-type) object.

- `ConnectorType` describes the type of the connector, its supported configuration properties and its factory object (called the [connector's provider](./concepts/connector-provider)). This information is used to create an instance of the connector at runtime.
- `Endpoint` describes the server endpoint where the third party data source or service is accessed from.

Connector types and endpoints can be reused in multiple connections.

![Structure of a connection object](./concepts/connection.svg)

### Factories

Each connector implementation has a factory object called a [*connector provider*](./concepts/connector-provider). The connector provider has two types of methods:

- Return a new instance of the connector based on the properties in a supplied `Connection` object. The `Connection` object has all the properties needed to create and configure the instance of the connector.
- Return additional information about the connector's behavior and usage to make it easier to consume. For example, the standard base class for a connector provider has a method to return the `ConnectorType` object for this connector implementation that can be added to a `Connection` object used to hold the properties needed to create an instance of the connector.

### Inside the connector

Each connector has its own unique implementation that is structured around a simple lifecycle that is defined by the OCF. The OCF provides the interface for a connector called [`Connector` :material-github:](https://github.com/odpi/egeria/blob/master/open-metadata-implementation/frameworks/open-connector-framework/src/main/java/org/odpi/openmetadata/frameworks/connectors/Connector.java){ target=gh } that has three methods: `initialize`, `start` and `disconnect`.

This connector interface supports the basic lifecycle of a connector. There are three phases:

1. *Initialization* - During this phase, the connector is passed the context in which it is to operate. It should store this information.

    This phase is initiated by a call to the connector's `initialize()` method, which is called after the connector's constructor and provides the connector with a unique instance identifier (for logging) and its configuration stored in a [connection](./concepts/connection). After `initialize()` returns, there may be other calls to pass context to the connector. For example, if the connector implements the [`AuditLoggingComponent` :material-github:](https://github.com/odpi/egeria/blob/master/open-metadata-implementation/frameworks/audit-log-framework/src/main/java/org/odpi/openmetadata/frameworks/auditlog/AuditLoggingComponent.java){ target=gh }, an [audit log](./frameworks/alf/overview) is passed to the connector.

2. *Running* - The connector is completely initialized with its context, and it can start processing.

    This phase is initiated by a call to the connector's `start()` method. At this point it should create its client to any third party technology and begin processing. It may also start up threads if it needs to perform any background processing (such as listening for notifications). If the connector throws an exception during start, Egeria knows the connector has a configuration or operational issue and will report the error and move it to disconnected state.

3. *Disconnected* - The connector must stop processing and release all of its resources.

    This phase is initiated by a call to the connector's `disconnect()` method.

Depending on the type of connector you are writing, there may be additional initialization calls occurring between the `initialize()` and the `start()` method. The connector may also support additional methods for its normal operation that can be called between the `start()` and `disconnect()` calls.

The OCF also provides the base class for a connector called [`ConnectorBase` :material-github:](https://github.com/odpi/egeria/blob/master/open-metadata-implementation/frameworks/open-connector-framework/src/main/java/org/odpi/openmetadata/frameworks/connectors/ConnectorBase.java){ target=gh }. The `ConnectorBase` base class manages the lifecycle state of the connector. For example, the default implementation of `initialize()` in the `ConnectorBase` class stores the supplied unique instance identifier and connection values in protected variables called `connectorInstanceId` and `connectionProperties` respectively.

!!! tip "Call the base class's methods in any overrides"
    If you override any of the  `initialize()`, `start()` or `disconnect()` methods, be sure to call `super.xxx()` at the start of your implementation to call the appropriate super class method so that the state is properly maintained.

## Extending Egeria using connectors

Egeria has extended the basic concept of the OCF connector and created specialized connectors for different purposes. The following types of connectors are supported by the Egeria subsystems with links to the documentation and implementation examples.

You can write your own connectors to integrate additional types of technology or extend the capabilities of Egeria - and if you think your connector is more generally useful, you could consider [contributing it to the Egeria project](./guides/community).

## Building open metadata archives

## Working with the open metadata and governance APIs

## Adding registered services
  
Registered services are optional services that plug into Egeria's [OMAG Server Platform](./concepts/omag-server-platform). There are 4 types:
  
  - [Open Metadata Access Services (OMAS)](./services/omas) provide specialized APIs and events for retrieving and maintaining open metadata.  These services run in a [Metadata Access Server](./concepts/metadata-access-server).
  
  - [Open Metadata Engine Services (OMES)](./services/omes) provide specialist APIs that support specific types of governance engines.  These services run in an [Engine Host](./concepts/engine-host) and call an OMAS to retrieve and maintain open metadata.
  
  - [Open Metadata Integration Services (OMIS)](./services/omis) provide specialist connector APIs for exchanging open metadata with third party technologies.  These services run in an [Integration Daemon](./concepts/integration-daemon) and call an OMAS to retrieve and maintain open metadata.
  
  - [Open Metadata View Services (OMVS)](./services/omvs) provide specialist REST APIs for browser-based user interfaces (UIs).  These services run in a [View Server](./concepts/view-server) and call an OMAS to retrieve and maintain open metadata.

There are many choices of registered services within the Egeria project.  However, you may add your own. The recommended modules for registered services (required if it is to be contributed to the Egeria project) are shown in the table below:

| Module naming | Description | OMAS | OMES | OMIS | OMVS |
| --------------|-------------|------|------|------|------|
| *moduleName*-api | Client java interface(s), property beans and rest beans. | CP | CP | CP | P |
| *moduleName*-client | Java client implementation. | CP | C | C | N |
| *moduleName*-topic-connectors | Java connectors for sending and receiving events.  | OCP | N | N | N |
| *moduleName*-server | Server-side REST and event management implementation.  | P | P | P | P |
| *moduleName*-spring | Server-side REST API.  | P | P | P | P |

**Key:**

* CP - Required and runs in external clients plus in the OMAG Server Platform.
* C - Required and runs in external clients.
* P - Required and runs in the OMAG Server Platform.
* OCP - Optional and when provided runs in external clients plus in the OMAG Server Platform.
* N - Not implemented/needed.

The modules for each registered service that need to run in the OMAG Server Platform are delivered in their own jar that is available to the OMAG Server Platform via the CLASSPATH.  Inside the registered service's spring jar are one or more REST APIs implemented using [Spring Annotations](./guides/contributor/runtime/#spring).  On start up, the OMAG Server Platform issues a *Component Scan* to gather details of its REST APIs.  This process loads the spring module which in turn loads the server and api modules of registered services it finds and they are [initialized as part of the platform's capabilities](./concepts/omag-server-platform/#inside-the-omag-server-platform) and are callable via the platform's root URL and port.  The client module of an OMAS is loaded by an OMES, OMIS or OMVS registered service that is dependent on the OMAS to get access to open metadata.

The best guide for building registered services are the existing implementations found in [egeria.git](https://github.com/odpi/egeria/tree/master/open-metadata-implementation){ target=gh }.  You can see the way the code is organized and the services that they depend on.

## Summary

Egeria is designed to simplify the effort necessary to integrate different technologies so that they can actively share and consume metadata from each other.

It focuses on providing five types of integration interfaces.

- [Connectors](#what-is-a-connector) that translate between third party APIs and open metadata APIs. These connectors are hosted in the Egeria servers and support the active exchange of metadata with these technologies.
- [Connectors](./guides/developer/using-connectors) for accessing popular type of data sources that also retrieve open metadata about the data source. This allows applications and tools to understand the structure, meaning, profile, quality and lineage of the data they are using.
- [Java clients](#using-the-clients) for applications to call the [Open Metadata Access Service (OMAS)](./services/omas) interfaces, each of which are crafted for particular types of technology. These interfaces support both synchronous APIs, inbound event notifications and outbound asynchronous events.
- [REST APIs](#using-the-rest-apis) for the Egeria Services. These include the [access services](./services/omas), admin services and [platform services](./services/platform).
- Kafka topics with JSON payloads for asynchronous communication (both in and out) with the open metadata ecosystem.
