# Discovery Configuration Server

The discovery configuration server is the server responsible for
holding and managing the configuration needed by the
[discovery servers](discovery-server.md) and
the [discovery engines](discovery-engine.md) within them.

This configuration consists of defining which [discovery request types](discovery-request-type.md) are supported and
which [discovery services](discovery-service.md) they map to.

## Implementation in Egeria

Egeria's discovery configuration server support is implemented by the
[Discovery Engine OMAS](./services/omas/discovery-engine/overview).
It has a client called `DiscoveryConfigurationClient` that implements the ODF's  `DiscoveryConfigurationServer` interface.
It also supports event notifications through  the [Discovery Engine OMAS's out topic](./concepts/out-topic).
