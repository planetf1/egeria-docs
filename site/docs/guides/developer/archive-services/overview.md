# Writing Archive Services

---8<-- "docs/connectors/archive/archive-service-intro.md"


## Interface

The interface that all archive services must implement is defined by [`ArchiveService` :material-github:](https://github.com/odpi/egeria/blob/master/open-metadata-implementation/engine-services/archive-manager/archive-manager-api/src/main/java/org/odpi/openmetadata/engineservices/archivemanager/connector/ArchiveService.java){ target=gh }:

> **Figure 1:** Methods implemented by an archive service

- `initialize` is a standard method for all connectors that is called by the [connector broker](./concepts/connector-broker) when the connector is created. The [connector](./frameworks/ocf/#connector) is passed the [connection](./frameworks/ocf/#connection) object from the configuration and a unique identifier for this instance of the connector.
- `setAuditLog` provides a logging destination (see [Audit Log Framework (ALF)](./frameworks/alf/overview)).
- `setContext` sets up the archive context. This provides an interface to the repository services (OMRS) that provide access to the open metadata.
    - The ability to register a listener to receive events from the [Enterprise OMRS Topic](./concepts/cohort-events/#enterprise-event-topic).
    - The ability to retrieve metadata instances from any connected open metadata repository.
- `start` indicates that the archive service is completely configured and can begin processing.  This call can be used to register a listener with the Enterprise OMRS Topic through the context and to update the archive store with the current state of the metadata in the repositories. 
- `disconnect` is called when the server is shutting down. The archive service should free up any resources that it holds since it is not needed any more.
