## Using the Community Profile OMAS

The Community Profile OMAS is designed to cover many of the administrative tasks relating to managing
information about people, teams and communities.

Most of the interaction with the Community Profile OMAS will be driven by individuals.
 
- All users will be able to manage their [personal profile](./concepts/personal-profile)
  and [lists of favourite assets, projects and communities](./concepts/favorite-things-collection).
  
- All users will be able to manage any [to dos](./concepts/to-do) that have been assigned to them.
  
- All users will be able to create a [community](./concepts/community) and administer it.
  This includes managing members, the communities resources and the notifications sent to the members.
  
- All users can also query the [communities](./concepts/community) and
  [teams](./concepts/organization/#team.md) they are a member of. 

- All users will be able to search for people, teams and communities.

There is also support for an administrator to create and delete personal profiles as individuals join and leave the
organization and also manage the organization's departmental structure.  The assumption is that the organization
already has at least one system that manages this information, and so Community Profile OMAS is designed to be integrated
with existing systems in order to keep the profiles and departmental structure up-to-date.

Below are the list of tasks supported by the Community Profile OMAS.

### One time set up by the administrator

Many organizations already have [a system that maintains information about their employees
and/or customers and/or business partners](./concepts/software-server-capability/#master-data-manager).
The Community Profile OMAS therefore supports an event exchange with such a system
to keep the profiles synchronized. 
The following tasks cover the work of the IT team to integrate the Community Profile
OMAS with other systems.

- [Loading personal profiles of existing members of an organization](#loading-personal-profiles)
  into an open metadata repository.
- [Synchronizing updates to personal profiles from another system](#synchronizing-personal-profiles)
- [Loading the organization's departmental structure](#loading-departmental-structures)
  into an open metadata repository.
- [Synchronizing the organization's departmental structure with another system](#synchronizing-departmental-structure)
- [Capturing karma point plateaus](#capturing-karma-point-plateaus)
  emitted from the Community Profile OMAS [OutTopic](./concepts/out-topic).
- [Synchronizing collaboration activity with another system](#synchronizing-collaboration-activity)

### Individuals working with their personal profile

A [personal profile](./concepts/personal-profile) provides a place for
an individual to share information about themselves
with the other people they are collaborating with.

Each personal profile is associated with one or more of the person's userIds.
It is retrieved using one of these userIds.

- [Retrieving my personal profile](#retrieving-my-personal-profile)

For organizations where the personal profile is not loaded from another system (see above)
an individual can maintain their own profile.

- [Creating my personal profile](#creating-my-personal-profile)
- [Updating my personal profile](#updating-my-personal-profile)
- [Removing my personal profile](#removing-my-personal-profile)

Once an individual has a personal profile, they will be awarded [karma points](./concepts/karma-point)
when they contribute content to open metadata.  An individual can query their karma points.

- [Retrieving my karma points](#retrieving-my-karma-points)

The individual can also maintain [collections](./concepts/favorite-things-collection) of their
favourite [Assets](./concepts/asset), [Projects](../../../docs/concepts/project)
and [Communities](./concepts/community) and control notifications
about changes to the contents of these lists.

An individual can access an manage a list of close colleagues
called their [peer network](./concepts/peer-network).

that have been assigned to them as part of one of these roles.

#### Retrieving my karma points

If an individual has a
[Personal profile](./concepts/personal-profile)
the Community Profile OMAS will reward him/her whenever
they contribute to open metadata.
These rewards are in the form of
[karma points](./concepts/karma-point).

The Community Profile OMAS is responsible for maintaining the count of
the karma points.  It does this by listening to the metadata changes
occurring in the metadata repositories and updates the personal
profile of each user making a contribution.

The Community Profile OMAS provides a method/operation
to allow an individual to retrieve their current karma point
total.

The access service option property *KarmaPointPlateau* indicates
the multiple of karma points for an individual that results in
an external event being published - the default is 500.  This
means that when an individual gets to 500 karma points, and event is sent,
and other event is sent when they get to 1000 karma points and so on.
These events can be used to trigger additional recognition activities for
the individuals concerned.







### Retrieving my personal profile

Every user accessing the open metadata ecosystem has a unique user identity (userId).
This identity is used for authentication, authorization and auditing of activity
related to open metadata and governance.

Optionally a user identity can be associated with a
[personal profile](./concepts/personal-profile).
This provides information about the user behind the userId
and aims to improve collaboration across the organization.

#### If you do not have a personal profile

An organization can choose to
[load personal profiles automatically](loading-personal-profiles.md)
Alternatively, it can be left to the individual to
[create their own personal profile](creating-my-personal-profile.md).



### Sending a personal message

Link through to adding a comment or separate method?


### Setting up my personal notes
