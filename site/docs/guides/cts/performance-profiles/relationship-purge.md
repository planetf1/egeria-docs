# Relationship Purge Profile

The performance of programmatically hard-deleting (irreversibly) existing relationship instances.

The [Open Metadata Repository Services (OMRS)](./services/omrs) interface for a metadata repository defines optional methods for hard-deleting relationship instances:

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `purgeRelationship` | completely removes a relationship instance homed in the technology under test (including all of its history) |
| `purgeRelationshipReferenceCopy` | completely removes a relationship instance that is homed somewhere other than the technology under test (including all of its history) |

???+ assertion "Assertions"
    | ID | Description |
    |---|---|
    | `repository-relationship-purge-performance-purgeRelationship` | See (3) in detailed logic below. |
    | `repository-relationship-purge-performance-purgeRelationshipReferenceCopy` | See (5) in detailed logic below. |

For every relationship type supported by the technology under test, this profile does the following (in order):

1. Searches for `instancesPerType` relationship GUIDs homed in the technology under test. (This uses `findRelationshipsByProperty` with a condition on `metadataCollectionId` and its performance is recorded as part of the [relationship search](relationship-search.md) profile.)
1. For each of these relationship GUIDs, `deleteRelationship` is called to soft-delete the instance. (This is necessary before a hard-delete can be done against the instance, and is recorded as part of the [relationship delete](relationship-delete.md) profile.)
1. For each of these relationship GUIDs, a `purgeRelationship` is then called to hard-delete the instance.
1. Searches for `instancesPerType` reference copy relationships. (This uses `findRelationshipsByProperty` with a condition on `metadataCollectionId` and its performance is recorded as part of the [relationship search](relationship-search.md) profile.)
1. For each of these reference copy relationship instances, `purgeRelationshipReferenceCopy` is called to remove the reference copy instance.

!!! example "Example"
    So, for example, if the technology under test supports 50 relationship types, and the `instancesPerType` parameter is set to 100, then this profile will remove 50 (types) x 100 (instances per type) x 3 (home + reference copy methods) = 15 000 relationships. (And it will run `findRelationshipsByProperty` 100 times.)
