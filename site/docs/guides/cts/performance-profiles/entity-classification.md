# Entity Classification Profile

The performance of programmatically classifying existing entity instances with new classifications.

The [Open Metadata Repository Services (OMRS)](./services/omrs) interface for a metadata repository defines optional methods for classifying entity instances:

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `classifyEntity` | adds a new classification to an existing entity instance, where the technology under test is the home repository for that classification |
| `saveEntityReferenceCopy` | adds (or updates) an entity instance with a classification, where the technology under test is _not_ the home repository for that classification |

???+ assertion "Assertions"
    | ID | Description |
    |---|---|
    | `repository-entity-classification-performance-classifyEntity` | See (2) in detailed logic below. |
    | `repository-entity-classification-performance-saveClassificationReferenceCopy` | See (4) in detailed logic below. |

For every classification type supported by the technology under test, this profile does the following (in order):

1. Searches for `instancesPerType` entities of a type that is valid for the classification. (This uses `findEntities` and its performance is recorded as part of the [entity search](entity-search.md) profile.)
1. For each of these entity instances, `classifyEntity` is called to add a new classification of this type to that instance, using a generated set of properties.
1. Searches for `instancesPerType` entities of a type that is valid for the classification, and where the entity is a reference copy. (This uses `findEntitiesByProperty` with a condition on `metadataCollectionId` and its performance is recorded as part of the [entity search](entity-search.md) profile.)
1. For each of these reference copy entity instances, `saveClassificationReferenceCopy` is called to add reference copy classification of this type to that instance, using a generated set of properties.

!!! example "Example"
    So, for example, if the technology under test supports 50 classification types, and the `instancesPerType` parameter is set to 100, then this profile will create 50 (types) x 100 (instances per type) x 2 (home + reference copy methods) = 10 000 classifications. (And it will run `findEntities` 50 times, and `findEntitiesByProperty` 50 times.)

The properties of each of these instances will be fully-populated with:

- Any string properties containing a value representative of the property name itself (and where unique, they will be made unique through appending a unique sequence)
- Any non-string properties will be randomly generated, in a simple attempt to represent data that is not entirely uniform
