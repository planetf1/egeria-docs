# Entity retrieval profile

The performance of programmatically retrieving existing entity instances based on their ID.

The [Open Metadata Repository Services (OMRS)](./services/omrs) interface for a metadata repository defines methods for retrieving entity instances by their ID:

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `isEntityKnown` | retrieves an entity instance's details, if available, or returns null if not |
| `getEntitySummary` | retrieves a summary of an entity instance, without its properties |
| `getEntityDetail` | retrieves an entity instance's details, if available, or throws an exception if not |

???+ assertion "Assertions"
    | ID | Description |
    |---|---|
    | `repository-entity-retrieval-performance-isEntityKnown` | See (2) in detailed logic below. |
    | `repository-entity-retrieval-performance-getEntitySummary` | See (3) in detailed logic below. |
    | `repository-entity-retrieval-performance-getEntityDetail` | See (4) in detailed logic below. |

For every entity type supported by the technology under test, this profile does the following (in order):

1. Searches for `instancesPerType` entity GUIDs of that type. (This uses `findEntities` and its performance is recorded as part of the [entity search](entity-search.md) profile.)
1. For each of these entity GUIDs, `isEntityKnown` is called to retrieve it.
1. For each of these entity GUIDs, `getEntitySummary` is then called to retrieve its summary.
1. For each of these entity GUIDs, `getEntityDetail` is then called to retrieve its details.

!!! example "Example"
    So, for example, if the technology under test supports 50 entity types, and the `instancesPerType` parameter is set to 100, then this profile will retrieve 50 (types) x 100 (instances per type) x 3 (operations) = 15 000 entities. (And it will run `findEntities` 50 times.)

!!! attention "Caveats"
    Note the following caveats:

    - The same GUIDs are used for each retrieval, but each method is run against every GUID before moving onto the next method.
