# Relationship Creation Profile

The performance of programmatically creating new relationship instances.

The [Open Metadata Repository Services (OMRS)](./services/omrs) interface for a metadata repository defines optional methods for creating relationship instances:

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `addRelationship` | adds a new relationship instance, where the technology under test is the home repository for that instance |
| `saveRelationshipReferenceCopy` | adds (or updates) an existing relationship instance, where the technology under test is _not_ the home repository for that instance |

???+ assertion "Assertions"
    | ID | Description |
    |---|---|
    | `repository-relationship-creation-performance-addRelationship` | Invocation of the `addRelationship` method during the profile (see detailed logic below). |
    | `repository-relationship-creation-performance-saveRelationshipReferenceCopy` | Invocation of the `saveRelationshipReferenceCopy` method during the profile (see detailed logic below). |

For every relationship type supported by the technology under test, this profile invokes each of these methods `instancesPerType` times.

!!! example "Example"
    So, for example, if the technology under test supports 50 relationship types, and the `instancesPerType` parameter is set to 100, then this profile will create 50 (types) x 100 (instances per type) x 2 (home + non-home methods) = 10 000 relationship instances.

The properties of each of these instances will be fully-populated with:

- Any string properties containing a value representative of the property name itself (and where unique, they will be made unique through appending a unique sequence)
- Any non-string properties will be randomly generated, in a simple attempt to represent data that is not entirely uniform

In addition, these tests will record into the Environment profile the `totalRelationshipsCreated`.
