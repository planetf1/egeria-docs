# 0205 Connection Linkage

The purpose of a [connector](./concepts/connector) is to access the content and related properties (metadata) about an [Asset](./concepts/asset) owned or used by an organization.

In order for the connector to provide details of the know properties of an Asset, the open metadata types support a relationship between a [Connection](./concepts/connection) and the Asset.

Notice that the connection can only be associated with one asset, although an Asset may support multiple connections, each providing a different class of service, or security permissions to the consumer.

In addition, some connectors are virtual connectors - by that we mean they implement an abstraction to a business level asset and internally use one of more technical connectors as part of their implementation. The metadata repository can reflect these connection relationships using a **VirtualConnection**.
