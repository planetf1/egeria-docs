# 0217 Ports

Ports are used to define the interfaces of [Processes](./types/0/0010-Base-Model).

![UML](0217-Ports.svg)

- **PortImplementation** - at the most detailed level, a PortImplementation defines the specific
    interface of a process: for example, its expected inputs or produced outputs.
- **PortAlias** - a PortAlias provides a reference point to some other Port (either another PortAlias
    or a more detailed PortImplementation).
- **PortDelegation** - defines the parent-child relationship between Ports: for example, which PortImplementation
    a particular PortAlias delegates to.
- **ProcessPort** - defines the Port(s) that are used by a given Process as its interface(s).
