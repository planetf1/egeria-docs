# 0461 Governance Engines

A [governance engine](./concepts/governance-engine) is a [software capability](./types/0/0042-Software-Capabilities) that is able to run specific services on demand.  These services, called [governance services](./concepts/governance-service), typically implement specific logic that is needed to govern an organization's resources or the metadata associated with them.

Open metadata recognizes three types of governance engine:

* [Governance action engines and services](./guides/developer/governance-action-services/overview) support the active governance of metadata and the resources they represent.  There are different types of governance action engines/services that are defined by the [Governance Action Framework (GAF)](./frameworks/gaf/overview).

* [Discovery engines and services]() support the analysis of [real world resources](./concepts/resource).  The results of this analysis are stored in a [discovery analysis report](./types/6/0605-Open-Discovery-Analysis-Reports) chained off of the corresponding [Asset](./types/0/0010-Base-Model#asset) metadata element. The interfaces for discovery are found in the  [Open Discovery Framework (ODF)](./frameworks/odf/overview).

* [Archive engines and services](./guides/developer/archive-services/overview) support the maintenance of [open metadata archives](./concepts/open-metadata-archive) that are defined in the [Open Metadata Repository Services (OMRS)](./services/omrs).

The capability of a *governance engine* is specified in a [governance engine definition](./concepts/governance-engine-definition).  This is a collection of open metadata elements starting with an entity of the appropriate `GovernanceEngine` subtype.  This is linked to `GovernanceService` entities via the `SupportedGovernanceService` relationship.  The `requestType` property in this relationship is used to map an incoming [governance request type](./concepts/governance-request-type) passed to the running governance engine into a governance service to invoke.  The `requestParameters` provide initial values of the request parameters passed to the governance services when it is called.  These are overlaid by any request parameters supplied by the caller.

*Governance services* are specialist [connectors](./concepts/connector).  They are represented in open metadata using the `GovernanceService` entity which is a specialization of [`DeployedConnector`](./types/2/0215-Software-Components).  This entity is linked to a [`Connection`](./types/2/0201-Connectors-and-Connections) entity via a [`ConnectionToAsset`](./types/2/0205-Connection-Linkage) relationship.

??? education "Further information"

    The [Open Metadata Engine Services (OMES)](./services/omes) support the implementation of each type of governance engine. They run in an [Engine Host](./concepts/engine-host) OMAG Server and draw their configuration from the  `GovernanceEngine` and the linked `GovernanceService` elements in the associated metadata server.
    
    The type definitions for discovery engines and services are shown in [model 0601](./types/6/0601-Open-Discovery-Engine).
