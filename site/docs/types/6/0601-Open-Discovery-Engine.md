# 0601 Open Discovery Engines and Services

An [open discovery engine](./concepts/open-discovery-engine) executes [open discovery services](./guides/developer/open-discovery-services/overview) on request. Open discovery services are pluggable components that analyse data sources and document the results.

The `OpenDiscoveryEngine` entity creates a description of an instance of these types of engines. It is represented as a special type [`GovernanceEngine`](./types/4/0461-Governance-Engines) when it is documented in metadata.

A description of an open discovery engine is linked with a [`SupportedGovernanceService`](./types/4/0461-Governance-Engines) relationship to the description of an `OpenDiscoveryService` to indicate that
the open discovery engine supports the open discovery service.

The `OpenDiscoveryService` entity describes an implementation of an open discovery service.  This implementation is an specialized [OCF Connector](./concepts/connector). The `OpenDiscoveryService` entity is a subtype of [`Asset`](./types/0/0010-Base-Model) and is linked with a [`ConnectionToAsset`](./types/2/0205-Connection-Linkage) relationship to a [Connection](./types/2/0201-Connectors-and-Connections) entity that defines how to create an instance of the open discovery service in the Egeria OMAG Server Platform.

[Open discovery pipelines](./guides/developer/open-discovery-services/discovery-pipeline) are specialized open discovery services that execute multiple open discovery services in a single run.

The `OpenDiscoveryPipeline` entity describes an open discovery pipeline.  It is typically linked to a [VirtualConnection](./types/2/0205-Connection-Linkage) with the connections of the open discovery services embedded within it.
