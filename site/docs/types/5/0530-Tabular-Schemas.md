# 0530 Tabular Schemas

Model 0530 shows the the structure of a single table. This could be a file that is organized into columns such as a [CSV file](./types/2/0220-Files-and-Folders).

Note that for such a simple structure, the type information for each column can be directly embedded on the **TabularColumn** through the [TypeEmbeddedAttribute](./types/5/0505-Schema-Attributes.md) classification.

??? deprecated "Deprecated types"
    The **TabularColumnType** entity has been deprecated because it restricts tabular columns to primitive types and some technologies will be able to support more types.
