# 0090 Cloud Platforms and Services

The cloud platforms and services model shows that cloud computing is not so different from what we have been doing before. Cloud infrastructure and services are classified as such to show that the organization is not completely in control of the technology supporting their data and processes.

## CloudProvider

The *`CloudProvider`* is the organization that provides and runs the infrastructure for a cloud service. Typically, the host it offers is actually a [`HostCluster`](./types/0/0035-Complex-Hosts/#hostcluster). 

The cloud provider may offer infrastructure as a service (IaaS), in which case, an organization can deploy [`VirtualContainer`s](./types/0/0035-Complex-Hosts/#virtualcontainer) onto the cloud provider's `HostCluster`.

## CloudPlatform

If the cloud provider is offering platform as a service (PaaS), an application may deploy software capability onto the *`CloudPlatform`*.

## CloudService

If the cloud provider is offering Software as a Service (SaaS) then it has provided APIs backed by pre-deployed software capability that an organization can call as a *`CloudService`*.
