# 0040 Software Servers

`SoftwareServer`s describe the middleware software servers (such as application servers, data movement engines and database servers) that run on the [`SoftwareServerPlatform`s](./types/0/0037-SoftwareServerPlatform).

The `SoftwareServerDeployment` relationship shows which platforms a server is deployed to.

Within the `SoftwareServer` type it is possible to capture the `userId` that it operates under. By storing the user identifier for the server, it is possible to correlate the server with the calls that it makes.

An [OMAG Server](./concepts/omag-server) is an example of a `SoftwareServer`.
