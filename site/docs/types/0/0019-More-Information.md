## MoreInformation

The *`MoreInformation`* relationship enables [`Referenceable`s](./types/0/0010-Base-Model/#referenceable) of different subtypes to be associated in a way that indicates that one provides more detail about another. It can be used to show linkage between a glossary and the primary top level category, between a glossary term and its implementation. It is a looser association that a relationship such as [`SemanticAssignment`](./types/3/0370-semantic-assignment/#semanticassignment).

The [Asset Manager OMAS](./services/omas/asset-manager/overview) makes use of this relationship to link an asset to a glossary term that is providing supplementary properties to the asset.
