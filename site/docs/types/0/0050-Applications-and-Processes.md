# 0050 Applications and Processes

![UML](0050-Applications-and-Processes.svg)

## Application

`Application`s provide business or management logic. They are often custom-built but may also be brought as a package. They are deployed onto a server as a [`SoftwareCapability`](./types/0/0042-Software-Capabilities/#softwarecapability).

??? deprecated "Deprecated types"
    The `RuntimeForProcess` relationship is superfluous: use [`ServerAssetUse`](./types/0/0045-Servers-and-Assets/#serverassetuse) since `Application` is a `SoftwareServerCapability`.
