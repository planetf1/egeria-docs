# 0770 - Lineage Mapping

Lineage Mapping identifies elements that are [equivalent to each other in the lineage graph](./features/lineage-management/overview/#stitching). It is used to stitch the lineage graph together.

This is contrast with the [Data Passing](./types/7/0750-Data-Passing) relationships that represent implementation relationships between components.
