# 0150 Feedback

## Feedback

An important principle of good metadata it to be continually capturing the experience of subject matter experts. The *feedback* model captures comments and ratings from subject matter experts.

![UML](0150-Feedback.svg)

Comments and ratings are a key mechanism for providing feedback on the metadata definitions by any user.  

*Note:* that because comments inherit from [Referenceable](./types/0/0010-Base-Model/#referenceable) they can be tagged, rated and commented on.
