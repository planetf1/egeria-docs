# 0117 IT Profiles

Often [IT infrastructure](./types/0/0030-Hosts-and-Platforms) runs as a background process with its own user identity. The ability to create an IT profile helps to identify which pieces of IT infrastructure is responsible for specific activity.

## ITProfile

`ITProfile` extends ['ActorProfile'](./types/1/0110-Actors/#actorprofile) to describe a piece of IT infrastructure.
The `ActorProfile` links to the `UserIdentity` entities for this piece of IT infrastructure.

## ITInfrastructureProfile

`ITinfrastructureProfile` links the actor profile to the [`ITInfrastructure`](./types/0/0030-Hosts-and-Platform) asset that represents the specific piece of IT Infrastructure that it represents.
