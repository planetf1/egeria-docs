# Introduction to the hands on labs
The final session in day one of the Egeria Dojo is to use our Kubernetes helm charts to set up the infrastructure for Egeria's hands on labs.  These labs attempt to show a rich metadata environment in action, allowing you to experiment with different concepts and APIs.

The scenario is based on a hypothetical pharmaceutical company known as 'Coco Pharmaceuticals'. When you
start working through the labs you'll be able to read a lot more about their business & Egeria environment.

These labs make use of a similar container-based environment to that you have used so far,
but coco has a more complex environment with more Egeria platforms. 

For the learning experience we have made use of Jupyter notebooks which can combine text and code. This is also included within the container environment

# Installing the labs

First, delete the Helm chart you used in the last part of the tutorial.
```console
$ helm delete base
```

Now, install the Coco Pharma environment
```console
$ helm install lab egeria/odpi-egeria-lab                                [15:16:18]
NAME: lab
LAST DEPLOYED: Fri Jan 14 15:16:33 2022
NAMESPACE: base
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
NOTES:
ODPi Egeria lab tutorial
---

The Egeria tutorials have now been deployed to Kubernetes.
It may take a minute or so for everything to start up.

Open your web browser and go to addressofmycluster:30888 to
get started

You may need to contact your cluster admin, or read your cloud provider helptext to understand
the correct 'addressofmycluster' to use.

If you experience problems, check memory consumption on your nodes. A minimum of
a 3 node cluster, 2GB per node; or a desktop environment with 6GB dedicated is recommended.

Please provide any feeback via a github issue at https://github.com/odpi/egeria or
join us on slack via https://http://slack.lfai.foundation

As before, repeat the following command until all the pods are in Running state - which may take several minutes:
```console
$ kubectl get pods                                                              [15:18:39]

```
We now have everything we need running to get into the labs.

## Explanation of what has been installed

From the above list of pods we can see

* Four Egeria platforms (core, datalake, dev, factory) - the use of these will become clear when you start the tutorials
* The Jupyter server for hosting our notebooks
* The react UI (as you used earlier in this dojo)
* Kafka/Zookeeper for messaging, as provided by Strimzi
* An additional UI - one lab will be using this

## Port forwarding

As before we need to enable access to some of these containers from your local environment using the 'kubectl port-forward' command.

Most of the interaction with the notebooks is via the jupyter server, so we run:

```console
$ kubectl port-forward service/lab-jupyter 8888:8888
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:8888 -> 8888
Forwarding from [::1]:8888 -> 8888
```

As you progress through the labs, if if you are interested in experimenting with postman, then you may need to setup port forwarding for other services too. If so, run each in the background, or in separate windows as they must continue running whilst you are working through the labs.

# Start working on the labs

Open up a web browser and go to http://localhost:8888

You should see a window similar to this:

![First Lab Notebook](/egeria-docs/education/tutorials/jupyter-tutorial/jupyter-notebook-browser-window.png)

In the navigator on the left of this Windows, navigate to the *read-me-first* and start following the instructions. We've tried to add lots of explanation at each stage to guide you through how Egeria can be used in a real environment.

There is more material to run in the Open metadata Labs than can be done in 30 minutes. The purpose of this session is to ensure that you can set up the environment so you can run it at you leisure when every you want to.

In addition, these labs (like everything else in Egeria) is evolving rapidly so it is worth checking back from time to time to see what is new. This also means some of the labs are incomplete. Visit the slack channel to check if you get problems.
