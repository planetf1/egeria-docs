# Release 3.4 (December 2021)

??? info "Known issue: use chromium-based browser for UIs"
    
    It is recommended to use a chromium-based browser such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge or Apple Safari for the Egeria React UI. Some parts of the UI experience such as Dino currently experience problems with Firefox. See [odpi/egeria-react-ui#96 :material-dock-window:](https://github.com/odpi/egeria-react-ui/issues/96){ target=gh }.

??? info "Known issue: Egeria React UI (Dino)"

    Config documents cannot be displayed in the Egeria React UI (Dino). See [egeria-ract-ui#264 :material-dock-window:](https://github.com/odpi/egeria-react-ui/issues/264){ target=gh }.

??? info "Known issue: OpenShift deployment using helm charts"
    
    If deploying helm charts to OpenShift, a security policy change is needed. See [odpi/egeria-charts#18 :material-dock-window:](https://github.com/odpi/egeria-charts/issues/18){ target=gh }.

??? info "Known issue: Helm chart deployments fail on arm64 (Apple M1, Raspberry pi 64 bit)"

    The docker images built by the Egeria team are now provided as multi-architecture images for both amd64 (Intel) and arm64 (Raspberry pi 64 bit & Apple m1).
    However at the time of release our 3.4.0 Helm Charts will not function successfully on arm64 since we do not yet
    have a Kafka implementation for arm64. This will be updated through our Helm charts outside the release cycle. Watch slack's #egeria-announce channel for further information.

???+ functional "Functional changes"

    ??? update "OMAG Server Platform Chassis & Connector Configuration Factory"

    The [Graph repository connector](https://github.com/odpi/egeria/tree/master/open-metadata-implementation/adapters/open-connectors/repository-services-connectors/open-metadata-collection-store-connectors/graph-repository-connector)
    is no longer a dependency of [Connector configuration factory](https://github.com/odpi/egeria//tree/master/open-metadata-implementation/adapters/open-connectors/connector-configuration-factory/README.md).  This means it will not be included into the [OMAG Server Platform](./concepts/omag-server-platform) jar.  To run an OMAG Server Platform that has server(s) that are using the Egeria graph repository,
    the connector's jar has to be placed into the classpath. The easiest way is to use Spring boot's loader.path property. Place the 
    jar in the 'lib' folder next to server-chassis-spring jar and run it with -Dloader.path=lib .

    ??? added "New function to return more detailed server status"

    A new REST API 'GET {{baseURL}}/open-metadata/admin-services/users/{{adminUserId}}/servers/{{serverName}}}}/instance/status' has been added to returned more detailed status for a server.

    For example a running server will return 

    ```
    {
    "class": "OMAGServerStatusResponse",
    "relatedHTTPCode": 200,
    "serverStatus": {
        "serverName": "cocoMDS6",
        "serverType": "Metadata Server",
        "serverActiveStatus": "RUNNING",
        "services": [
            {
                "serviceName": "Subject Area OMAS",
                "serviceStatus": "RUNNING"
            },
            {
                "serviceName": "Open Metadata Repository Services (OMRS)",
                "serviceStatus": "RUNNING"
            },
            {
                "serviceName": "Community Profile OMAS",
                "serviceStatus": "RUNNING"
            },
            {
                "serviceName": "Asset Consumer OMAS",
                "serviceStatus": "RUNNING"
            },
            {
                "serviceName": "Discovery Engine OMAS",
                "serviceStatus": "RUNNING"
            },
            {
                "serviceName": "Data Science OMAS",
                "serviceStatus": "RUNNING"
            },
            {
                "serviceName": "Asset Catalog OMAS",
                "serviceStatus": "RUNNING"
            },
            {
                "serviceName": "IT Infrastructure OMAS",
                "serviceStatus": "RUNNING"
            },
            {
                "serviceName": "Asset Owner OMAS",
                "serviceStatus": "RUNNING"
            },
            {
                "serviceName": "Asset Manager OMAS",
                "serviceStatus": "RUNNING"
            },
            {
                "serviceName": "Connected Asset Services",
                "serviceStatus": "STARTING"
            },
            {
                "serviceName": "Data Manager OMAS",
                "serviceStatus": "RUNNING"
            },
            {
                "serviceName": "Glossary View OMAS",
                "serviceStatus": "RUNNING"
            },
            {
                "serviceName": "Data Engine OMAS",
                "serviceStatus": "RUNNING"
            },
            {
                "serviceName": "Project Management OMAS",
                "serviceStatus": "RUNNING"
            },
            {
                "serviceName": "Governance Engine OMAS",
                "serviceStatus": "RUNNING"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

    whilst a server still starting could return:
    ```
    {
    "class": "OMAGServerStatusResponse",
    "relatedHTTPCode": 200,
    "serverStatus": {
        "serverName": "cocoMDS2",
        "serverType": "Metadata Server",
        "serverActiveStatus": "STARTING",
        "services": [
            {
                "serviceName": "Open Metadata Repository Services (OMRS)",
                "serviceStatus": "STARTING"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
    Specifically, the serverActiveStatus is defined as
    ```
    UNKNOWN    The state of the server is unknown. 
    STARTING   The server is starting.
    RUNNING    The server has completed start up and is running.
    STOPPING   The server has received a request to shutdown.
    INACTIVE   The server is not running.
    ```
