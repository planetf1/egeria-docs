## 2.11 (July 2021)

!!! danger "Special note on Java support"
    This is expected to be the last release supporting Java 8. The next release will commence the 3.x series of
    releases and will require Java 11.

??? tip "Known issue: use chromium-based browser for UIs"
    It is recommended to use a chromium-based browser such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge or Apple Safari for
    the Egeria React UI. Some parts of the UI experience such as Dino currently experience problems with
    Firefox. See [odpi/egeria-react-ui#96 :material-dock-window:](https://github.com/odpi/egeria-react-ui/issues/96){ target=gh }.

???+ functional "Functional changes"

    ??? added "Multiple topics for a cohort"
        An [open metadata repository cohort](./services/omrs/cohort)
        uses three types of events to enable peer-to-peer sharing of metadata.
        In previous releases, these events have all been exchanged through a single
        event topic.  Release 2.11 provides the option for a cohort to
        use a dedicated topic for each type of event.
        This improves the time to register a new member in the cohort
        and allows multiple instances of a [metadata access server](./concepts/metadata-access-server)
        to access the cohort.
    
        Details of these new options can be found in the
        [administration guide](./guides/admin/configuring-registration-to-a-cohort).
    
    ??? added "Data Manager OMAS extension to support capture of event metadata"
    
        The [Data Manager OMAS](./services/omas/data-manager)
        has been extended to support the capture of metadata from
        Event Brokers such as Apache Kafka and API Managers
        such as an API Gateway.
    
        There are two new associated
        Open Metadata Integration Services (OMISs)
        to support integration connectors 
        that extract metadata from these types of data managers:
    
        - [Topic Integrator OMIS](./services/omis/topic-integrator/overview)
          supports integration connectors extracting metadata
          from Event Brokers.
        - [API Integrator OMIS](./services/omis/api-integrator/overview)
          supports integration connectors extracting API information from API managers.
    
        For more information on the use of the Data Manager OMAS with
        these integration services, see the 
        [Data Manager Integration](./scenarios/data-manager-integration)
        solution.
    
    ??? removed "Information View OMAS, Virtualization Services, Security Officer Services, Gaian connector"
        The following capabilities have now been removed (they were previously deprecated and/or in not in 'Released' status):
    
        - Information View OMAS
        - Virtualization Services and associated connectors
        - Security Officer Services, Security sync services and associated connectors including for Apache Ranger
        - Gaian database connector and additional authentication/impersonation support
    
        Much of the above capability can be implemented via [Integration Services](./services/omis) .
        Hadoop specifics may be developed in the future within the [Egeria Hadoop](https://github.com/odpi/egeria-connector-hadoop-ecosystem) GitHub repository.
    
        For more details of this change see [#5314](https://github.com/odpi/egeria/pull/5314).
    
    ??? removed "Data Platform Services, Data Platform OMAS, and Cassandra connectors"
        Similarly, the following services have been deleted:
    
        - Data Platform Services and Data Platform OMAS. For more details see [#5344](https://github.com/odpi/egeria/pull/5344) .
        - Data Platform capabilities are already available in [Database Integrator](./services/omis/database-integrator/overview) and [Files Integrator](./services/omis/files-integrator/overview) already part of Integration Services.
        - Cassandra connectors: cassandra-data-store-connector and cassandra-metadata-extractor-connector will be introduced back
          in the [Data Connectors](https://github.com/odpi/egeria-data-connectors) GitHub repository. For more information see [#2671](https://github.com/odpi/egeria/issues/2671) .

???+ types "Type changes: :material-plus-circle: added, :material-adjust: modified, :material-alert-circle: deprecated"
    ??? added "APIManager, EventBroker"
        New types for **APIManager** and **EventBroker**.
        These types inherit from [SoftwareServerCapability](./types/0/0042-Software-Capabilities).
        These are used in the new Data Manager OMAS APIs.

        See new type descriptions in model [0050](./types/0/0050-Applications-and-Processes.md).

    ??? added "Threat"
        And a relationship to connect a [GovernanceDefinition](./types/4/0401-Governance-Definitions)
        with a metadata element that defines the scope where it is applicable.

        See new type descriptions in models [0401](./types/4/0401-Governance-Definitions) and
        [0405](./types/4/0405-Governance-Drivers).

    ??? added "TabularFileColumn"
        A new subtype for `TabularColumn` called `TabularFileColumn` is added to be able to distinguish between tabular columns from
        files and `RelationalColumn` (which also inherits from `TabularColumn`).

        See type descriptions in model [0530](./types/5/0530-Tabular-Schemas).

    ??? added "EventTypeList"
        New type called `EventTypeList` to allow a list of event types to be associated with a topic
        and a specific subtype of [SchemaAttribute](./types/5/0505-Schema-Attributes.md)
        for an attribute in an event type to make it easier to search for
        data fields that are exclusively found in events.

        See new type descriptions in model [0535](./types/5/0535-Event-Schemas.md).

    ??? added "APIParameter, APIOperation"
        New types for `APIParameter` to allow the capture of properties
        related to the API's treatment of the parameters.  There are also
        properties for `APIOperation`.

        See new type descriptions in model [0536](./types/5/0536-API-Schemas).

    ??? added "Types for display of data to end users"
        New types for `DisplayDataSchemaType`, `DisplayDataContainer`, `DisplayDataField`, `QuerySchemaType`,
        `QueryDataContainer` and `QueryDataField` to allow the capture of properties related to the display of data to end users.

        See new type descriptions in model [0537](./types/5/0537-Display-Schemas).

    ??? modified "RelationalTableType"
        Updated supertype of `RelationalTableType` to inherit from `ComplexSchemaType` rather than `TabularColumnType`
        since `TabularColumnType` is now deprecated.

        See type descriptions in model [0534](./types/5/0534-Relational-Schemas).

    ??? deprecated "Asset properties"
        A number of properties that where originally defined in Asset were moved to
        classifications to allow them to be managed independently of the original asset.
        This occurred before the TypeDefPatch support was in place and so these properties
        were not marked as deprecated at that time.  In 2.11, this deprecation has now been
        officially recorded in the Asset TypeDef.  The properties are:

        - `owner` - now captured in the [Ownership](./types/4/0445-Governance-Roles) classification
        - `ownerType` - also captured in the Ownership classification
        - `zoneMembership` - now captured in the [AssetZoneMembership](./types/4/0424-Governance-Zones) classification
        - `latestChange` - now captures]d in the [LatestChange](./types/0/0011-Managing-Referenceables) classification

        See new type description in model [0010](./types/0/0010-Base-Model).

    ??? deprecated "TabularColumnType"
        Deprecated type called `TabularColumnType` because it restricts tabular columns to primitive types when it
        could be a literal for example.

        See type descriptions in model [0530](./types/5/0530-Tabular-Schemas).

    ??? deprecated "SimpleDocumentType, StructDocumentType, MapDocumentType"
        Deprecated types called `SimpleDocumentType`, `StructDocumentType` and `MapDocumentType` because they
        offer little value since the type is typically stored in the `TypeEmbeddedAttribute` classification.
        This change makes the document schemas consistent with other types of schema.

        See type descriptions in model [0531](./types/5/0531-Document-Schemas).

    ??? deprecated "TermISATypeOFRelationship"
        Deprecated `TermISATypeOFRelationship` because the ends are defined the wrong way round. When visualizing
        end1 should point to end2. This relationship incorrectly has the super type pointing to the subtype. Use the new
        `IsATypeOfRelationship` instead to represent an is-a-type-of relationship between two spine objects.

        See new type descriptions in model [0380](./types/3/0380-Spine-Objects).
