# Release 3.1 (September 2021)

!!! danger "Special note on Java support"

    Java 11 is now **required** to build and run Egeria.

??? info "Known issue: use chromium-based browser for UIs"

    It is recommended to use a chromium-based browser such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge or Apple Safari for the Egeria React UI. Some parts of the UI experience such as Dino currently experience problems with Firefox. See [odpi/egeria-react-ui#96 :material-dock-window:](https://github.com/odpi/egeria-react-ui/issues/96){ target=gh }.

???+ functional "Functional changes"
    ??? deprecated "docker-compose"

        The docker-compose environment for running our Coco Pharmaceuticals lab demo/tutorial is now deprecated. The configuration is still available, but will not be further developed or tested, and will be removed in a future release.

        Our [Kubernetes Helm charts :material-dock-window:](https://odpi.github.io/egeria-charts/site/index.html) are now recommended to quickly setup the same lab environment, and the documentation for these has been improved to cover a Kubernetes introduction, and example based on 'microk8s' which are suited to an end-user desktop environment (and can also be run in enterprise/cloud environments).

    ??? added "Distinguishing between virtual machines, containers and bare metal hardware"
        There are now types for distinguishing between virtual machines and virtual containers as well as bare metal hardware. There are also new types for specific technologies such as `HadoopCluster`, `KubernetesCluster` and `DockerContainer` to provide concrete examples of different types of hosts using popular technologies.

    ??? added "Storage volumes"
        There are new types for defining a storage volume that has been attached to a host. See description in [model 0036](./types/0/0036-Storage).

    ??? modified "OperatingPlatform"
        The `OperatingPlatform` entity can now record the patch level of the operating system. There are also new types for describing the contents of an operating platform. See description in [model 0030](./types/0/0030-Hosts-and-Platforms).
