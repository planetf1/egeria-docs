# Release 3.0 (August 2021)

!!! danger "Special note on Java support"
    Java 11 is now **required** to build and run Egeria.

??? info "Known issue: use chromium-based browser for UIs"
    It is recommended to use a chromium-based browser such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge or Apple Safari for
    the Egeria React UI. Some parts of the UI experience such as Dino currently experience problems with
    Firefox. See [odpi/egeria-react-ui#96 :material-dock-window:](https://github.com/odpi/egeria-react-ui/issues/96){ target=gh }.

    ??? change "Java 11 required"
        As of Release 3.0 of Egeria, Java 11 is **required** to build and run Egeria.

        Egeria will not build / run / be supported on Java 8. Developers are now able to use Java 11 only functionality.

        Java releases beyond Java 11 up to the current release have some informal testing, and we do build verification
        on the current release (currently 16).

        See [Java](./guides/contributor/languages/#java) for further information.
    
    ??? change "Defaults to multiple topics for cohorts"
        The option added in [release 2.11](../2-11/) to allow multiple topics per cohort now becomes the default in
        release 3.0.
    
    ??? change "Changed passwords"
        Passwords for the sample Coco Pharmaceuticals users were changed to `secret`.

???+ bugs "Bug fixes and other updates"
